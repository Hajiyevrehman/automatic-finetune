    "question": "Rachel makes a certain amount as a waitress in a coffee shop. In one hour, she serves 20 different people and they all leave her a $1.25 tip. She made $37 in that hour. How much does she make per hour without tips?",
    "answer": "To determine how much Rachel makes per hour without tips, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Tips:**\n   \n   Rachel received a $1.25 tip from each of the 20 people she served.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Tips} = 20 \\text{ people} \\times \\$1.25/\\text{person} = \\$25\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Earnings Without Tips:**\n   \n   Rachel's total earnings for the hour were $37, which includes both her base pay and the tips.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings Without Tips} = \\text{Total Earnings} - \\text{Total Tips} = \\$37 - \\$25 = \\$12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   Rachel makes \\(\\boxed{\\$12}\\) per hour without tips.",

    "question": "Alex had some ounces of jelly beans. He ate 6 ounces. Then he divided the rest equally into 3 piles, and each pile weighs 10 ounces. How many ounces of jelly beans did Alex have initially?",
    "answer": "**Solution:**\n\nLet's determine the initial amount of jelly beans Alex had.\n\n1. **After Eating 6 Ounces:**\n   \n   Alex ate 6 ounces of jelly beans. Let the initial amount of jelly beans be \\( x \\) ounces. Therefore, the remaining jelly beans after eating are:\n   \\[\n   x - 6 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Dividing into 3 Equal Piles:**\n   \n   Alex divided the remaining jelly beans into 3 equal piles, each weighing 10 ounces.

This upcoming Monday, 3 of Lucas' students will not be coming to class, and he will make 28 pieces of chocolate candy. How many pieces of chocolate candy did Lucas make for his class last Monday?",
    "answer": "Let's determine how many pieces of chocolate candy Lucas made for his class last Monday.\n\n**Step 1: Find the Total Number of Students**\n\nLet \\( S \\) represent the total number of students Lucas has.\n\nThis upcoming Monday, 3 students will not be attending, so Lucas will be making chocolate candy for \\( S - 3 \\) students.\n\nHe will make a total of 28 pieces of chocolate candy for these students, with each student receiving 4 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times (S - 3) = 28\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Solve for \\( S \\)**\n\n\\[\n4S - 12 = 28\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4S = 28 + 12\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4S = 40\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{40}{4} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, Lucas has a total of **10 students**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Last Monday's Chocolate Candy**\n\nLast Monday, all 10 students were present. Since Lucas makes 4 pieces of chocolate candy for each student, the total number of pieces he made is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 10 = 40\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]",
