## Implementation Decisions and Details

### Model Selection Decision
- **From Llama to Qwen**: We transitioned from Llama 3.1 to Qwen2.5 models due to Llama's access restrictions
- **Qwen2.5 Benefits**: Qwen2.5 is an accessible model family with strong performance and fewer usage restrictions
- **Multiple Model Sizes**: Support for 7B parameter model for development and 72B for production deployment

### Data Pipeline Architecture
- **Modular Components**: Each data processing step is implemented as a separate module
- **DVC Integration**: All data artifacts are versioned and tracked with DVC
- **Pipeline Stages**:
  1. Convert: Download and transform the ServiceNow dataset to Q&A format
  2. Preprocess: Clean and normalize text data
  3. Validate: Quality checks on the dataset
  4. Tokenize: Qwen2.5-specific tokenization with chat templates
  5. Split: Create train/validation/test datasets

### Cloud Infrastructure Approach (NEW)
- **AWS S3 for Storage**: DVC configured to use S3 as remote storage
- **Environment Variables**: Authentication handled through environment variables
- **No-SCM Option**: Support for DVC without Git integration for flexibility
- **Programmatic Resource Creation**: S3 buckets created and configured via Python API
- **S3 Integration Pattern**: Each pipeline stage downloads from S3, processes locally, and uploads results back to S3
- **Security Best Practices**: IAM user with specific S3 permissions rather than root credentials

### Tokenization Implementation
- **Chat Template Format**: Implementation of Qwen2.5's specific chat template
- **Message Structure**:
  ```
  [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}
  ]
  ```
- **Tensor Conversion**: Proper handling of tokenized outputs for model training

## Current Project Status
The data processing pipeline has been successfully implemented, tested, and integrated with AWS S3 storage. The pipeline can:
- Convert the ServiceNow-AI/R1-Distill-SFT dataset to a suitable Q&A format
- Preprocess and clean the text data
- Validate the data quality
- Tokenize the data using Qwen2.5's chat template format
- Split the data into training, validation, and test sets
- Store all data artifacts in S3 cloud storage
- Synchronize data between local and cloud environments
- Be executed via DVC reproducible pipeline or direct CLI commands

The pipeline is version-controlled with DVC using S3 as remote storage and can be reproduced consistently across environments.
