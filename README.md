# MLOps LLM Fine-tuning Project

A comprehensive MLOps pipeline for fine-tuning Large Language Models using Hugging Face Transformers, focusing on efficient techniques like LoRA and QLoRA with SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) in cloud environments.

## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for fine-tuning Large Language Models, with a focus on:

- Data preparation and versioning
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA)
- Model versioning and experiment tracking
- Cloud-based training infrastructure
- Scalable model deployment
- Monitoring and observability

The pipeline is designed to leverage cloud resources for training larger models like Llama 3 (8B) and deploying them efficiently in production environments.
